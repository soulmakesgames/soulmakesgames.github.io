        <em>What's the game goal?</em>
        <p>&nbsp Long ago in the Edo era, a famed samurai got caught by the riverside by a famed Kappa. The Kappa attacked in search of his
          shirikodama, but the samurai fought back and mutual blows were dealt. In a surprise twist, the shirikodama became sentient and consumed
          the Kappa, becoming a god in of itself; the Mass Cluster. Today, it is tradition that fledgling ninjas far and wide visit the land where
          the samurai met his fate in an effort to upset and escape the shirikodama's curse. The ninjas that can escape become enveloped in fame,
          the ones that can't are consumed and cursed to wander the land hunting for the next to take the challenge.
        </p>
        <em>What's the story behind the development?</em>
        <p>&nbsp This was made for the "Horror For My Valentine" game jam. From its initial inception, I had the basics of a goal;
          "You are a part of me" was the theme, so I thought why not make a ball that rolls forever forward, absorbing players and
          enemies. Each entity consumed makes the ball a greater threat as player and enemy becomes a part of it.<br>After the initial
          creation; once the jam was over, I took a step back to think about what I learned. I notably noticed a few issues with the
          original work.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>> Players were confused at my initial tutorial level</li>
          <li>> There was an unfair difficulty ramp that was poorly explained</li>
          <li>> The game having an infinite amount of levels removed some of my leaderboard goals</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp Taking everything into consideration once the jam was over I took a step back and remade some aspects to better explain to the player,
          through simpler gameplay mechanics, everything the player needed to learn without using wordy tutorials. I wanted the game to be "easy to 
          play, difficult to master" and quick to jump in and try to get a high score without the game having a "forever length". So, I finally released v2 of
          Mass Cluster. With, hopefully, a healthy dose of challenge and fun. I understand some of the gameplay mechanics can be a little harder to master but I
          tried to blend mechanics as much as I could to make something that took some practice to complete. I gave the tutorial some signs and I set up some practice
          walls to learn some mechanics early and I set a cap on the levels. 30. If you make it all the way, you get bonus points. And there's even upgrades you can
          wager points on to help you complete the game easier.
        </p>
        <em>Any oddball bits from development?</em>
        <p>
          &nbsp There was one notable one that I'm fairly sure was caused by my cat. I had an issue where the game would crash upon hitting the "Start" button. No fancy errors,
          in fact there was no errors at all. It was just... Crashing. It went on for about a month before I did something about it. I found out, through a lovely member
          of the Discord community for Godot who helped me debug, that the mass cluster's particle effect's gradient effect was <i>slightly</i> larger than normal. Normally,
          this shouldn't have even been an issue. And I couldn't replicate it on any other project. It was just some perfect storm that caused a random crash roughly 60% of
          the time.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <img id="brandlogo" src="images/logo.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="500" height="500">
      <p>I grew up playing all kinds of games and it was always a dream of mine to make my own. I have a fond memory of my late father
        chuckling when he asked me what I wanted to do with my life, asking me to consider something a little easier to break into. He
        never meant any ill will - after all, making games at this point was a very miniscule market to break into. Especially in my
        small province. And doubly especially so with my age at the time. <br><br>I took the challenge in strides, and me being the
        stubborn soul I am, I took everything as a challenge and made it my goal to focus on software development for a career and a
        hobby to ensure I could do everything I told him I would. Now that making games is as accessible as ever to anybody owning a
        PC, this was the logical best next step. I hope you enjoy the work I put together, and feedback is always welcome, both positive
        and negative. If you would ever like to reach out regarding anything, please feel free to reach out at
