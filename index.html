        <em>What's the game goal?</em>
        <p>&nbsp You're a ninja. You have no memory of why you are where you are. In this arcade adventure,
          escape the Mass Cluster as it rolls its way through this dynamic world. There are 50 randomly generated levels
          and a high score list to prove you are the Mass Cluster champion. Every 10 levels you have a timed decision to
          make for a small upgrade. You have two choices; wager your points in an effort to get further or risk it all to
          achieve glory. The rules are simple, but your execution is what matters.</p>
        <em>What's the story behind the development?</em>
        <p>&nbsp This was made for the "Horror For My Valentine" game jam. From its initial inception, I had the basics of a goal;
          "You are a part of me" was the theme, so I thought why not make a ball that rolls forever forward, absorbing players and
          enemies. Each entity consumed makes the ball a greater threat as player and enemy becomes a part of it.<br>After the initial
          creation; once the jam was over, I took a step back to think about what I learned. I notably noticed a few issues with the
          original work.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>> Players were confused at my initial tutorial level</li>
          <li>> There was an unfair difficulty ramp that was poorly explained</li>
          <li>> The game having an infinite amount of levels removed some of my leaderboard goals</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp Taking everything into consideration once the jam was over I took a step back and remade some aspects to better explain to the player,
          through simpler gameplay mechanics, everything the player needed to learn without using wordy tutorials. I wanted the game to be "easy to 
          play, difficult to master" and quick to jump in and try to get a high score without the game having a "forever length".

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <img id="brandlogo" src="images/logo.png" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="500" height="500">
      <p>I grew up playing all kinds of games and it was always a dream of mine to make my own. I have a fond memory of my late father
        chuckling when he asked me what I wanted to do with my life, asking me to consider something a little easier to break into. He
        never meant any ill will - after all, making games at this point was a very miniscule market to break into. Especially in my
        small province. And doubly especially so with my age at the time. <br><br>I took the challenge in strides, and me being the
        stubborn soul I am, I took everything as a challenge and made it my goal to focus on software development for a career and a
        hobby to ensure I could do everything I told him I would. Now that making games is as accessible as ever to anybody owning a
        PC, this was the logical best next step. I hope you enjoy the work I put together, and feedback is always welcome, both positive
        and negative. If you would ever like to reach out regarding anything, please feel free to reach out at
